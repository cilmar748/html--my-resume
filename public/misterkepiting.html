    <h2>About Mister Kepiting Business</h2>
    <p> Mister kepiting is my first online culinary business
        that I made with my older brother. The reason why we
        chose online rather than offline business was because
        we didn't have enough money at that time. The system
        of the business was pre order and it was really
        effective at that time and the cashflow of the business
        was really good. But we agreed to stop because all of us
        was so busy at that time and none of us had time for this
        business, but it really gives me lots of insight and educate
        me a lot.
